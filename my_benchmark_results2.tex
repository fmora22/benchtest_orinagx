\textbf{Metrics:} Latency = mean per-image inference time. Throughput = images per second. GPU\% = average GPU compute utilization (via pynvml on Dell GB10; not available on Thor/Orin). CPU\% = average CPU utilization. RAM = average system memory used. Power = average power draw (Thor/Orin use tegrastats VDD\_GPU, Dell uses pynvml). Tokens/sec = total tokens / duration. TPS/Watt = efficiency (Tokens/sec per Watt). J/Token = energy cost. --- = Not tested or not available.
